## ðŸ‘‹ Hey, I'm Zihan

I'm a third-year [Industry Doctorate Program (IDP)](https://www.uts.edu.au/research-and-teaching/graduate-research/future-research-students/uts-research-degrees/industry-doctorate-program) PhD student at theÂ [University of Technology Sydney (UTS) NLP group](https://utsnlp.github.io/), sponsored by the industry partner [TPG Telecom](https://www.tpgtelecom.com.au/). I have broad research interests centred around natural language processing (NLP). As an IDP PhD student, I am particularly passionate about developing NLP systems that are practical, robust, efficient, and can be applied to the industry.

Recently, my research focus has moved towards Large Language Models (LLMs) and exploring how to use them in production to drive business. My recent efforts involve adapting LLMs to world knowledge, which includes developing efficient, trustworthy, and robust Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) methods for Question Answering (QA) and Dialogue systems.
